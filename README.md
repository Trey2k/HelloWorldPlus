# To compile
To compile this most useful program on windows you will need to install MinGW if using make, it will probably compile with MSVC too but has not been tested.

When compiling for linux it is as simple as installing ncurses on debian based distro it would be as follows:
`sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-de`
You will also need to have make and gcc isntalled. After that you can run make
